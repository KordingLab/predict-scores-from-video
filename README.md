# Predicting scores from video

Pose estimation code adapted from: [Open MMLab: MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose)  
Feature computation code adapted from: [Chambers et al 2020](https://github.com/cchamber/Infant_movement_assessment)  
Score prediction code adapted from: [auto-sklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn)

Pipeline for predicting any score (e.g., clinical scores, sports performance scores) or other relevant variable from videos of moving humans of any age. Repository comprises:

1) Pose estimation
2) General timeseries pre-processing
3) General kinematic feature computation
4) Implementation of AutoSklearn
